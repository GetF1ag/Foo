Anyone with read permissions to a repository can create a pull request, but you must have write permissions to create a branch. 
If you want to create a new branch for your pull request and don't have write permissions to the repository, you can fork the repository first. 
For more information, see "Creating a pull request from a fork" and "About forks."
